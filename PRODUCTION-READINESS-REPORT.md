- **Response Times**: Track API response latencies for performance regression detection

## Deployment Recommendations

### Immediate Deployment Readiness
The library is ready for immediate production deployment with the following configurations:

1. **Production Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/db
   ```

2. **Database Indexing** (Required for performance)
   ```javascript
   // Essential indexes for production
   await DocumentModel.collection.createIndex({ username: 1, createdAt: -1 });
   await DocumentModel.collection.createIndex({ username: 1, title: 1 }, { unique: true });
   ```

3. **Health Check Integration**
   ```javascript
   app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
     if (ensureMongoDB(res)) {
       res.json({ status: 'healthy', timestamp: new Date().toISOString() });
     }
   });
   ```

### Scaling Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Architecture supports multiple application instances
- **Database Scaling**: MongoDB replica sets and sharding compatible
- **Caching Strategy**: In-memory storage replaceable with Redis for distributed caching
- **Load Balancing**: Stateless design enables standard load balancing approaches
