/**
 * In-Memory Storage Implementation - Volatile user storage for development and testing
 * 
 * This implementation provides a simple, fast storage mechanism that doesn't require
 * external dependencies. Data is stored in application memory and will be lost when
 * the application restarts.
 * 
 * Use cases:
 * - Development environments where data persistence isn't critical
 * - Testing scenarios that need clean state between test runs
 * - Prototype deployments with minimal infrastructure requirements
 * 
 * Limitations:
 * - Data loss on application restart
 * - No persistence across deployments
 * - Memory usage grows with user count
 * - Not suitable for production at scale
 * 
 * Performance characteristics:
 * - O(1) lookup by ID using Map data structure
 * - O(n) lookup by username requiring full scan
 * - Minimal latency since all data is in memory
