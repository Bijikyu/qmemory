# Test Failure Analysis

Analyze and address the following test failures:

## Failed Test 1: /home/runner/workspace/tests/generated-tests/demo-app.GeneratedTest__post.test.ts

### Output:
```
  ● Test suite failed to run

    The name `expect` was looked up in the Haste module map. It cannot be resolved, because there exists several different files, or packages, that provide a module for that particular name and platform. The platform is generic (no extension). You must delete or exclude files until there remains only one of these:

      * `/home/runner/workspace/.cache/.bun/install/cache/expect@29.7.0@@@1/package.json` (package)
      * `/home/runner/workspace/.cache/.bun/install/cache/expect@30.2.0@@@1/package.json` (package)
